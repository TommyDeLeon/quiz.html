# 📝 Project Documentation: Mastering Accessibility by Building a Quiz 🎓

Welcome to Part 9 of our journey! This is where we dove into the world of accessibility in HTML. Let's explore the creation of this accessible quiz! 😊

## 🛠️ Technology Used
This project is a beautiful blend of **HTML**, **CSS**, and the **freeCodeCamp platform**. HTML is our canvas, structuring the content of the webpage, while CSS is our palette, styling the webpage to perfection. The freeCodeCamp platform is our stage, hosting the project and handling form submissions.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into the world of accessibility and CSS styling. We learned how to:
- Create an accessible quiz using HTML and style it using CSS 📝
- Use various HTML elements and attributes to improve accessibility, such as role, aria-labelledby, accesskey, and visually hidden text (.sr-only) 🎨
- Style the quiz and make it responsive, ensuring it looks great on any device 🖥️📱

## 🎨 What Was Created
We crafted an accessible HTML/CSS quiz. The quiz includes sections for student info, HTML questions, and CSS questions. Each question is presented in a fieldset with a legend, and the answers are radio buttons. The quiz also includes a navigation menu with access keys, guiding users through the quiz with ease.

## 💡 Ideas to Make It Better
### Interactivity:
Our quiz is currently a one-way street. Adding some JavaScript could make it a two-way conversation, providing immediate feedback on the answers. Imagine being able to know right away if an answer is correct or incorrect! 🖱️
### More Questions:
Let's expand our quiz with more questions to make it more challenging and educational. After all, learning is a lifelong journey! 📚
### Scoring:
Let's implement a scoring system to track the user's progress and display a score at the end of the quiz. It's always rewarding to see how far you've come! 🏆
